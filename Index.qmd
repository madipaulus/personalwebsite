## Madison Paulus

![](IMG_3149.JPG){fig-alt="Image of Madison Paulus"}

Hello! My name is Madison Paulus and I am a student at George Washington University (GWU) studying International Affairs and Journalism and Mass Communication. I have extensive background in childcare which I attribute my strong communication skills to. Additionally, I have experience with science communication through my work with Planet Forward and GWU's Climate Health Institute. Beyond school and work, my passions include advocacy, mental health, anti-racism, and climate change.

## Running Code 

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
