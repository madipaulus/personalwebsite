Hello! My name is Madison Paulus and I am a student at George Washington University (GWU) studying International Affairs and Journalism and Mass Communication. I have extensive background in childcare which I attribute my strong communication skills to. Additionally, I have experience with science communication through my work with Planet Forward and GWU's Climate Health Institute. Beyond school and work, my passions include advocacy, mental health, anti-racism, and climate change.

Here is my [resume](personalwebsite/Madison Paulus Resume.pdf at main Â· madipaulus/personalwebsite (github.com)). Feel free to reach out with any questions or opportunities.
